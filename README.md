Creates an instrument which produces circles of random size and color. 
The circles, when clicked, play a note whose pitch is determined by the circle's luminosity and whose volume is determined by the size of the circle. Using sliders, the user can control the range of colors and rage of size of circles produced, as well as the speed at which circles appear.
